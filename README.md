## How to use

Here is a JavaScript example of fetching the entire API. Just change tha value of the const ``baseUrl`` for changing the URL being fetched. ``baseUrl`` value can be changed by an endpoint of this (or another) API for fetching different APIs <br>

```javascript

const baseUrl = "https://hp-api.onrender.com"

fetch(baseUrl)
	.then((res) => res.json())
	.then((data) => {
		// It fetches all data at the API and it returns it at the console
		console.log(data)
	})
	.catch((e) => console.log(e));

```

## Endpoints

* <https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters> - Fetches information about the characters from the API
* <https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters/students> - Exclusively fetches the Hogwarts students data from the API.
